It will give you about 2 more inches for deficit movement, without having to strain your neck back . Also reduces the strain on your wrists since they are at a more severe angle than normal. With the foam yoga blocks, you won&#39;t hurt your knuckles. 2) If you do this at home, do it in front of the stairs. You can adjust the angle by changing which stair tread you use. 3) Use a weight vest for overloading. Once you do this for a while, you&#39;ll start blowing out the # of reps and will need to increase the load to keep seeing growth. You can use the vest for overloading a lot of other body weight exercises too, like squats.",

            "When measured by weight (like in grams or ounces), fine sea salt and kosher salt have the same sodium content since they&#39;re both just sodium chloride (NaCl). The only difference comes when measuring by volume (like teaspoons) because kosher salt&#39;s larger flakes take up more space. 1 tsp of fine salt holds more crystals than 1 tsp of kosher salt, so you&#39;d get more sodium that way. But if you&#39;re weighing your salt (which is more accurate for baking!), 100g of either salt will give you the same sodium content. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPUux4h4Mf8&amp;t=304\">5:04</a>"

            "Bro, go to settings and click on initial tune parameters enter prop size and battery type, if you are using mission planner. I recommend mission planner. Reduce p , I , d (keep p and i equal)  of both roll and pitch till you get a stable hover in stabilize flight mode. Better use a telemetry radio instead of connecting a laptop to it every time. Reduce p and I in larger steps than D. All these value can be found in extended tuning tab of mission planner. Now once you get a stable hover , switch to althold with mot_thst_hover param set to 2. Disable it after a 30 second flight by changing the parameter to 0. Plug in the hover learn value into throttle to accel gains p= hover learn, I = 2*hover learn, then takeoff in althold and switch to loiter. If everything is fine, you can proceed with autotune. Don&#39;t use dampers for autopilot, it already has two IMUs damped internally. Square tubes (motor arms) can cause vibration because of pulse from the propeller,  passing over it , better use a round pipe or try notch filtering. Probably, you can&#39;t autotune it if the flight time is very less.",

I would like to encourage you to buy any property adjacent to yours if you can afford it. Encroachment is a real problem in many places and the only way to avoid it is to buy the property as it becomes available. If you don&#39;t then the people that get it might start complaining about you.  Too much noise, too much dust, too much smoke, too many trucks,  etc. And if you decide to get livestock then there is the smell. The only way to protect yourself is to separate yourself from the complaining.  You&#39;ve got a good thing going going and I and many others enjoy watching. Hang in there.",

            "TIP:   When &quot;trimming&quot; the edge guide of a new saw (or replacement), do not put it OVER the edge of the wood.  Instead, find a scrap piece, and make an actual cut... trimming the edge guide in the process.  This gives you a much cleaner and more accurate edge.<br><br>Or, maybe that&#39;s just with the cheaper track saws... haven&#39;t been able to afford an expensive one LOL",
            "The reason that Makita doesn&#39;t seem as exciting as other tool brands comes down to their core culture as a high quality Japanese tool company.  They don&#39;t rush into anything, they don&#39;t jump on bandwagons, and they don&#39;t release anything until they think it is ready.  This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t make mistakes, or that they don&#39;t occasionally miss the mark; but it does mean that their build quality is top notch and when they do release a new tool, it is often a game changer in that tool class.  The flip side is that they release a new model every 7-10 years instead of every 2 years.  They take that time to study how the tool is used and how it breaks so that the next one is better.  I appreciate that they don&#39;t try to make the most powerful tool, they try to make the best tool for the job and job rating.  Sure, you can take a Milwaukee and push it till it screams and it will most often the most powerful version of that tool, but it will tear itself apart while doing that. A Makita will just shut off if you start asking it to do something it isn&#39;t intended to do.  On their impact wrenches people often complain that you can&#39;t slap a too big socket on it and blow it to bits, but the makita will just shut down and tell you &quot;go get a bigger wrench that is meant for this bulldozer, I&#39;m designed for a civic&quot;."

            "Son. I turn 42 tomorrow and as a kid helmets and life vests never existed . We came home everyday scraped up, scaled up and laughin about it every day . I grew up my entire life in Clearwater beach Florida.  Fishing, huntin, 4 wheelin. You got hurt ment you had some fun. Dad always said two things. What did you lear , and then walk it off. I love how your raising your boys. It\u2019s how we were raised and how kids should still be raised. My oldest daughter who is twenty is half and half. Half girly but ain\u2019t afraid to get dirty, my 9 year old daughter ain\u2019t girly at all and is all tomboy. She\u2019s my feral child. Won\u2019t wear shoes, catchin bugs outside all day, always wants to go fishin. Bring back our generation and teach them right.",

            "It makes me feel so many positive feelings in the wake of your not only mentioning helmets for the boys, but telling them the plan to acquire said helmets in the near future.

When you get home you feel like you rode a hard tail sportster down a pothole pocked dirt mountain road!! Plus the silica dust is a keillor!! Definitely no fun over 40!! Those guys are beasties pounding those chipping hammers all day. Can&#39;t get those muscles at a gym, never felt a grip like a Mason, thin wiry Iron Muscle, crush your hand like a daisy, hands are hard like dried leather. Much respect and admiration to all working on this one, I will admit I&#39;m just a little jealous, this is a beautiful example of how to do it right, even if it costs you a bit of time. In the end the timeless structure will last long after we are all gone.  That is what I love most about restoration, bringing it back from the brink and making it shine once again for future generations to enjoy.",

            "I worked as a CNA for a while, and me and one of my patients decided to play a prank on the dour old nurse on duty. The patient had a catheter, so I hid the bag on the back of the chair. I got a new catheter bag and filled it up with white grape juice, then strapped it to her leg (she was in on it, and wanted to do it) just like a normal catheter. When the nurse came in to assess her for the am meds, I pretended like I was emptying the catheter into a brand new measuring cylinder. After draining the very uriney-looking juice into the container, I stood there chatting up the nurse, and then casually just started taking sips... <br><br>She didn&#39;t notice the first one, but the second time her eyes went wide and she shrieked &quot;what the hell are you doing?!!&quot; By then, the patient was convulsing with silent  laughter. <br><br>We also had a young guy who was paralyzed, but alert and responsive. I asked him if he wanted to play a prank on the oncoming night shift girl, and he nodded yes, and grinned. He was pretty big, so I usually had him in bed and squared away before she came on. That night, I pushed his chair into the bathroom like usual, but left him in it and threw a sheet over him, tucked just to the side so he was hidden, but could still see what was happening. I then went and laid down in his bed and covered myself with the sheet, and put my limbs in the position he was usually stuck in. <br><br>When she came in to check on him, she pulled the sheet back and I jumped out. She screamed so loud half of the administration came running down from the nurse&#39;s station to see what was wrong. The guy was in the corner laughing his head off and grinning from ear to ear.

            "As a risk of rain 2 (and other rougelikes) fan I have to say I REALLY dislike the fact that majority of the artifacts have huge downsides, risk of rain has it where all of the regular items give you flat buffs and only special items (Lunars) give you both a positive and negative, however, the positive and negative combine to completely alter the gameplay: for example stone flux pauldron doubles your health but halves your movement speed. The way the downsides cripple OTHER towers seems so backwards to me, I understand how it\u2019s trying to get you to only use that tower or similar towers but I feel like it should where it strengthens a tower in one way but nerfs that same tower in a different way to change how you use that single tower building more opportunities for synergies between towers with new and cool ways to use each of them (also making an opening for more artifact diversity)",

Saw a lady a few weeks ago who had a very run down small car with a broken back window. We live in Oregon where it rains most of the year. She had a newborn and toddler car seat in the back. If I was rich, this is something I would have fixed for her. But like most Americans, I\u2019m barely getting by.",

When I tell you we service cars like this all the time I am not exaggerating. Pretty much every 5 cars is similar to this or other very dirty ones you&#39;ve covered. It has been helpful to see your work and inspirational to me. I have started to lose the happiness for my job that I first had because of the specific nature of everything going on in the work place that out of professionality I will refrain from discussing. Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s less than desirable but I still try to be grateful and work with what I have. Anyways your videos have reignited my passion for detailing so just wanna say thankyou!"

It&#39;s really important to tell the lab to try their best to get them flat in order mitigate this. The second tip is to use 50% opacity and &quot;invert&quot; in photoshop to correctly align the focal point. After shooting over 100 rolls thru a Nimslo in the poundland glory days I came up with this and you can edit a whole roll in 5-10 mins when they&#39;re not warped :) Never seen this cam before tho, looks gorgeous!",

            "Hey brother, retired fire inspector here. You are very lucky that you didn&#39;t lose your home to fire. Oily stain type finishes and even cooking oil stained rags  have a known history of self ignition when balled up and packed in a bag or other combustible container. I remember a fire destroyed a million dollar home 2 or 3 weeks before the owners moved in. The flooring contractor was staining real wood floors and trim. His uninformed workers balled up the old stained rags and thew them in a corner. During the night they generated heat , ignited and burned the home down.

I love getting to watch how your brain works at overcoming supply and materials issues, logistics of massive projects, etc. You were absolutely meant to do this. Never ever stop my friend.",

            "As someone who has made a tradition of eating Orville Movie Theater Butter popcorn while watching movies with my son, I have discovered that the amount of time the popcorn spends in the microwave is critical to its flavor. Waiting until there are 3 or 4 seconds between pops can often take quite a while after the majority of the kernels have already popped, and that leads to not only the slightly burned flavor, but it absolutely kills the butter flavor as well. You get a far better flavor by stopping the microwave a little early and dealing with a few more unpopped kernels. It&#39;s amazing the difference only 10 or 20 seconds makes - it&#39;s almost like the butter flavor boils off.",

Especially since these videos are in the public domain and you have admitted on more than one occasion that you are only using the current stairs &quot;to fool the code inspectors&quot; or to &quot;pass code&quot;.  Protect yourself, your family, and your future as a Youtuber, please.",
            "In Europe we use something called the &quot;stair formula&quot;. The rule is that &quot;2x riser height plus 1x tread depth equals 65 cm / 26 inch&quot; (which is the length of a human step). This means that you can make stairs as steep as you want, but when the riser height increases, the tread depth has to decrease accordingly. Applying this rule will result in comfortable stairs, no matter how lazy or steep.<br>The way you typically use this formula is that you take the distance from floor to floor, divide it by the number of steps (an integer value) which gives you the riser height. Then use the stair formula to determine the tread depth.<br>For example when the floor to floor height is 10 foot (120 inch) you can do 15 treads (the upper floor counts as one), resulting in a riser height of 8&quot; and therefore a tread depth of 10&quot;. But for a steeper stair (maybe space is limited) you can decrease the number of treads to 12 where each step has a rise of 10&quot; and a tread depth of 6&quot;. Both examples will work well, but the second one is getting close to a ladder. Of course when you need things like 11 or 13 steps, going metric and using a calculator makes this all much easier.<br>I&#39;ve never seen this rule applied in North America. But especially outside sidewalks have often horrible stairs that make you stumble."

He took part in the rescues of the 86 survivors picked up by Dorsetshire, before the rescue efforts had to be abandoned. One of the men he helped onboard, a member of turret &quot;Dora&#39;s&quot; gun house crew named Friedrich Junghans, gave dad his &quot;erkennungsmarke&quot; or dogtag in gratitude. Post war dad tried to return the dogtag to Friedrich but was unable to trace him. He later found out that Friedrich had died in Los Angeles USA in 1973, so in 1993 dad donated Friedrich&#39;s dogtag to the &quot;Merseyside Maritime Museum&quot; in Liverpool UK where it is still on display to this day.",

I saw him on remembrance Sunday wearing his RAF gear and some medals, I recognised most but not one that was huge and shiny, he told me it was, &quot;A coffee tin lid&quot;. I found out later where he got it. After spending time flying Lancasters he was swapped to teaching Poles how to fly, he said it was the scariest thing he ever did because they HATED the NAZI, (quite understandably I thought) and would fly at them no matter what. It was quite the statement considering he won the medal, which was Polish, for flying Polish spies into occupied Poland in a little Lysander aircraft. Thank you for reminding me of my friend."

            "As a dental professional of 25 years we see younger and younger kids asking about teeth bleaching when it really isn&#39;t necessary all because society says you have to have insanely white teeth that look like tic tacs.  Can we normalise naturally white teeth which can have a very slightly yellowish hue, which is totally NORMAL?  I talk more people out of bleaching to save their money than to promote it, the exposure to social media and people constantly seeing influencers and celebrities with bad veneers and crowns which are very unnatural and insanely white.  I have had to pull out the shade guide and they are always surprised when I show them how white their teeth actually are.<br>Normal brushing/flossing and low staining foods with a hygiene appointment every 6 months is sufficient, imo.  It does make me sad to hear young children asking about bleaching when they have naturally white teeth already, societal &#39;norms&#39; are changing and there are a lot of dentist making money from people being insecure about their natural coloured teeth.",
            "As a dental assistant, you&#39;re spot on! Another thing I would add to reduce sensitivity is not <b>just</b> brush with Sensodyne (or any equivalent with potassium nitrate) but after brushing, get a paper towel, dry your teeth, then rub some Sensodyne on them. Concentrate on the areas you&#39;re most sensitive - gum recession, etc. Leave it on for like 10 min then spit it out. We tell our patients to do this every day at least 2 weeks before starting any whitening treatment, as well as in between sessions.",
            "You changed my life in a positive way Dr. Idriss. I have been following you for 2 years and pretty much followed all of your advice - from skincare to hair and now teeth. It took about two years - but today people ask me what I did to look so young for 60 years old. The answer now (after all these treatment) is too long to explain. It is a full time job - but I love it. Thank you, thank you and thank you for your devotion and thoroughness in explaining to us the various options. You are my hero!"

My dessert is always Greek Yogurt with dark unsweetened chocolate and a teaspoon of Allulose. My proteins are ground beef, sardines, salmon, and very rarely chicken for a change of pace. I will add a sweet potato or chickpea pasta in for a day if I get too cold (I get cold on Keto). I currently weigh 170lbs - ripped to shreds. I walk my dogs daily for exercise and once a week weight workout. I did not have to do a lot of cardio. I take a multi, CoQ10, &amp; Magnesium daily as supplements. I had open heart surgery 3 years ago to replace my aortic valve. I had a 5mm hole in it due to endocarditis. I also have Hemochromatosis which has damaged my liver with fibrosis. I require quarterly blood treatments for the rest of my life. After each treatment I eat liver to bring my hemoglobin back up. I found slow smoking the liver on the grill with onion &amp; garlic powder tastes the best to me.",

I\u2019ve learned so much from Paul and this channel, and I\u2019ve been watching since the early days. Still my favorite channel and so happy that you guys are creeping up on 700k subscribers.

            "I felt awful that the beginners were confused in the last video!! I hope this clears it up and helps everyone. Let me know if there is anything you do not understand here.<br><br>Also this video is not referring to offgrid specific inverters! The flex boss is a hybrid inverter running in off-grid mode. The gateway allows you to run hybrid and grid tie inverters, without the grid. I call this &quot;offgrid&quot; because its not connected to grid. Hopefully this does not cause any confusion. Please let me know below if it does.<br><br>A gateway can be called &quot;smart transfer switch&quot; or &quot;micro grid interconnection device&quot; or a host of other names. If it goes between the panel and the meter, it&#39;s all the same. Just a large transfer switch.<br><br>Final update: only EG4 hybrid inverters can connect to the grid boss hybrid ports! You can connect any brand of grid tie inverter to the smart ports, The load terminals of the flexboss, or connect them to your panel. But this is not true for hybrid inverters. It has to be EG4 to work with grid boss hybrid ports",

Obviously, a glass electrode would run the risk of damage or drying out electrolite, so it may seem attractive to try to get PH via Zink pin (video said Stainless steel) It is at best a guess. The NPK isn&#39;t even attempted to be &quot;measured&quot; but is calculated inside of the sensor as a function of the soil EC &amp; guessed pH values. They say &quot;Reference&quot; because these values have basically NO meaning outside of there MAYBE being higher or lower values though this is dubious at best.<br><br>I love your videos, but just wanted to point this out to other before they attempted to invest time or money into something that is basically a random number generator with a builtin Temperature &amp; moisture sensor (the EC values aren&#39;t too bad from our tests though)",

            "Hey Seth. I work at a bike shop in Nebraska and we&#39;re a Specialized dealer and I&#39;m certified as a Turbo mechanic through Specialized. If you haven&#39;t done it already or not aware, bring it to a local Specialized dealer to get a firmware update so that the motor, battery and TCU are properly connected. The Specialized app can do some minor updates but a dealer can do the necessary bigger ones which are needed from time to time. He should also connect the bike to the Specialized app (if he hasn&#39;t already) and it can tell him when those updates are needed and run basic diagnostics. He can also play with the parameters of each level of assist which can maximize battery efficiency based on the riders use of the bike. Very nice work on the bike!!!!"

I would worry about the spray foam staying stuck to the silvered stuff behind. Scoring the silver cover of the backing foam would&#39;ve been a good idea. Also, cutting the shiny surface off the spray foam is done to make a better surface for the cement to bond with. The cement tends to flake off on the uncut surface. The whole thing looks great though. Can&#39;t wait to see the finished product.",

I have a Personal Trainer, use many of his and your exercises and train on average 16 times each calendar month, most at home, two each month with my PT. I have done the exercise in this video, with the slow decent, but not so far with the slow accent  as well.

            "Potato chips, often dismissed as mere junk food, can surprisingly offer some unexpected benefits when consumed in moderation and prepared correctly. While it&#39;s true that conventional chips are often high in unhealthy fats and sodium, opting for baked or air-fried versions can provide a satisfying crunch with less guilt. These healthier alternatives can be a source of quick energy due to their carbohydrate content, and when made with quality oils, they can even contribute to your intake of heart-healthy fats. Additionally, potato chips seasoned with natural herbs and spices can offer antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it&#39;s crucial to balance these potential benefits with the risks of overconsumption, such as weight gain and increased blood pressure, reminding us that moderation is key in enjoying this popular snack.  Like any other food we need to remind ourselves of mindfulness. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "My 17 year old grandson was in a roll over accident that left him as a quadriplegic. He only had control of his body from his head to his shoulders. But not down to his feet. He could move his arm but his fingers were gnarled. His brain functioned normally as he could speak and think. Some times I would sneak into his room at night and find him weeping. This broke my heart to see him looking out the window at other PPL doing what he should have been doing. We talked many a time about things. <br><br>He would say, &quot; grandpa please get me some weed or even a bottle of crown to help ease my emotional pain . At first I would tell him that doesn&#39;t help. But after awhile I could not stand to see him suffer. The alcohol and weed helped him through a lot of pain I knew he was emotionally feeling. <br><br>I&#39;ve been criticized for this on numerous occasions. But I felt his pain and gave him what he wanted. He passed 10 days before his 20th birthday. But he died peacefully after his spinal cord injury. I don&#39;t regret my actions. I was told he would die young by doctors. I know where his Spirit went as we talked about the after life and he gave his heart to the Lord. He has been relieved from his suffering which brings me peace. But I cry a lot as I miss him dearly. But the hope I have is that we will meet again at the resurrection. God rest his soul.",

            "The biggest issue with Beeching was the attitude of BR (and the governments of the time) to the axed lines. It wasn&#39;t enough to just close the lines, they had to be destroyed immediately as well. It was as if they didn&#39;t want to permit the possibility that they could be proved wrong. Track was ripped up and scrapped, no one was allowed to buy lines to operate privately, land was sold for development. This was the greatest error. Deciding to close unprofitable lines was understandable given the way things looked at the time. Making sure they could never be reopened if the world changed was the true crime.",
            "Beeching was commissioned to deliver exactly what the government of the day wanted all along, they wanted a reduction in active railways, and Beeching was the useful &quot;scapegoat&quot; to deflect attention away from the Government to get exactly that.<br><br>If not Beeching, the government would have simply found someone else happy to deliver what they wanted."

Criticism is fair, but issuing death threats or targeting his family, especially his mother, is completely wrong. No one deserves harassment for a mistake. At the same time, this controversy is being given so much attention that it is overshadowing bigger national issues like air pollution, the Manipur crisis, and other serious matters. It feels like the government and media are using this issue to distract people from more pressing problems.<br><br>However, what Ranveer said was completely inappropriate and should not be normalized in any way. Jokes that involve sensitive topics like incest, even in the name of dark humor, are not acceptable in society. Public figures must be careful with their words because their influence is huge. While people should be given a chance to correct their mistakes, we also need to make sure that such comments do not become normal or acceptable in public discourse.",

I would find two or three Funnel Webs every week. They looked dead until you scooped them out and placed them on the deck. After several minutes they would slowly come to life. I would place them in a jar and take them to a nearby ambulance station and they would then send them on to Sydney Wildlife Park where they were milked for their venom to produce antivenom. Caught hundreds over the years I was there.",
            "Lived in Sydney all my life. in 1963 I was helping my dad in the garden and I was bitten by one that I accidentally walked on. 60 years later I can remember the pain on my ankle. By the time I got to hospital I could not feel below my waist. I was put in a coma and woke up 4 days later. No antivenom back then. I was in hospital for two weeks. The reported number of deaths is vastly under reported as stats have only been collected since about 1960. I admire your courage.  And now they have discovered the Big Boy Funnel Web. Its 50% bigger than the one you have there."

            "In this video, I show y&#39;all a 3-In-1 thermal solution that can be a dedicated thermal scope, handheld monocular, &amp; even a thermal clip-on to use with your LPVO. You might be surprised to find out how much they go for. It&#39;s the DNT Hydra and there are 3 models to choose from here: <a href=\"https://us.dntoptics.com/ujhK3z\">https://us.dntoptics.com/ujhK3z</a> The ones featured in this video are the HS225 and HS635. Using code &quot;texasplinking&quot; at checkout, the HS225 goes for $797 and the HS635 goes for $1,998. Watch the video to see which might suit your needs best. <br>I showcased these as clip-ons with the Arken EP8 which is also awesome value. It&#39;s just under $315 using that same code &quot;texasplinking&quot; at checkout here: <a href=\"https://shorturl.at/EFOqj\">https://shorturl.at/EFOqj</a><br>If you don&#39;t plan to use these as clip-ons, I still recommend you consider the ThermNight. Similar to the Hydra but where you lose clip-on mode, you gain a digital day mode, digital night vision, laser rangefinder, and IR light illumination. ThermNight: <a href=\"https://us.dntoptics.com/LpfyVc\">https://us.dntoptics.com/LpfyVc</a><br>Between the Hydra HS225 &amp; HS635, the difference in resolution is noticeable yes, but the biggest difference to me is that minimum magnification of 1.5X. That opens up that field of view much wider which is great for all 3 applications. (Especially for clip-on use) But for under $800, that HS225 is pretty insane! More than usable as a dedicated thermal and clip on no doubt. <br>Thanks for watching!",

            "I had no intention of making two anti-Amazon videos in a row. I didn&#39;t even want to make another video about Amazon, as I&#39;d like to focus on philosophical ideas and great books. But this news is time-sensitive, so I wanted to make a video right now to get the word out. <br><br>Look up Calibre and guides for removing DRM. Look for alternative ereaders. Buy physical media. Support local booksellers.<br><br>EDIT: There are some recurring questions in the comments. I can&#39;t address them all, but here are some thoughts.<br><br>Question: What is DRM?<br><br>DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It is software that limits how you can use a digital asset. It the case of Kindles, DRM locks you into the Kindle ecosystem. It also helps to prevent piracy. This is the crux of the issue: in order to prevent piracy, companies restrict how you can use what you buy. <br><br>Question: Why not just pirate?<br><br>I want to support authors and artists. <br><br>Question: Does this affect your ability to read books on your Kindle or on a Kindle app?<br><br>No. This prevents you from downloading the files onto a folder on your computer, which you can currently do in order to save a local copy (or to use a program like Calibre to strip the DRM). <br><br>Question: Is it legal to remove DRM?<br><br>I am not a lawyer. I said in the video that to the best of my knowledge it was legal (thinking here only about using the content for personal use), but obviously the law is complex and varies by jurisdiction. You&#39;ll want to do your own research before taking any action.",

The Romans were great at integrating recently-acquired territory and people into Romans. Creating colonies was just the first step. The many other aspects of Romanization is one of my favorite topics to discuss (despite the absence of military matters) and I will definitely be dedicating a full long video on their other methods, a lot of which are surprisingly still present in our everyday lives...

Obviously sea currents are a thing, so while surfaced, turn off propulsion and measure the velocity to get a sea current vector. Use this measurement to offset derived location.<br><br>For turning you should use rudders not fins, ie. place them after the propeller. That way you get a sort of thrust vectoring."

I comply of course and as a thanks,  my wife and I get invited to join the gallery owner, Dan, Phil, Carroll and a few others for dinner\u2026like 10 of us total and I sat next to Dan. I reminded him of our previous meetings in 1970 and 2000 which he recalled!  What a special evening!!!<br>Edit: Is the 1970 cockpit upstairs from the same Eagle that I saw him win with in 1970?

I truly value your talent immensely as do, I\u2019m sure, all your viewers. You are able to take us to the place, time,  and evoke the feelings of your subject. That ability is what absolutely makes for a memorable  and great yarn. I really just want to genuinely thank you for your talent and more importantly the compassion you consistently show  for all your victims and respect you show their families. It is a quality that defines us as human beings. I\u2019m sure you make your parents all too proud! What you do is more valuable than you probably know. All of these tales are more than entertaining and encourage outdoor safety. I can imagine you may have saved a life or two from what people learn from these stories. Just thank you for sharing your talent with all your fellow man! Sincerely, thank you. Keep going!"

            "A complete or partial break in a bone.<br>A bone fracture is a complete or partial break in a bone. Causes include trauma, overuse and diseases that weaken bones.<br>Symptoms include a limb or joint that looks out of shape, or a bone that has poked through the skin. If the broken bone is an arm or a leg, the toe or finger may become numb or change color at the tip.<br>Treatment often involves resetting the bone in place and putting it in a cast to allow it time to heal. Sometimes, surgery or metal rods may be needed to reset the bone. A broken bone usually heals in 4 to 8 weeks, but healing time can vary widely. Healing depends on many factors, including the type of bone, the severity of the break, and the person&#39;s age and health. <br>Factors that affect healing time<br>Bone type: Smaller bones heal faster than larger bones. <br>Break severity: The more severe the break, the longer it will take to heal. <br>Age: Children heal faster than older adults. <br>Health: Underlying health conditions like diabetes or osteoporosis can slow healing. <br>Lifestyle: Smoking, poor nutrition, and lack of exercise can slow healing. <br>Healing phases<br>Healing occurs in three phases:<br>Inflammatory phase: Bleeding and cell death occur at the fracture site. <br>Repair phase: New bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue form at the fracture site. <br>Remodeling phase: The fracture callus is replaced with new bone over many months. <br>Tips for faster healing Eat a healthy diet with lots of protein, Avoid smoking, Rest and limit activity, Immobilize the broken bone, and Align the broken bone fragments Take Dietary Supplements. ...<br>Maintain a Well-Balanced Diet. ...<br>Limit Your Intake of Salt, Caffeine, Sweetened Beverages and Soda. ...<br>Do Not Drink Alcohol or Smoke. ...<br>Avoid Certain Drugs. ...<br>Moderate Exercise. ...<br>Do Not Put the Fractured Bone to the Test. Seven years earlier, the first victim was found in a strange location with his left hand hacked off; subsequently, two other visitors vanished without a trace. The present study examines characteristics of hacking and blunt force skeletal trauma in order to determine if there is a point at which blunt force trauma ... I think the last we hear of Hacker is season 6, Dr. His name shows up on Booth&#39;s phone when they are called to the crime scene.",
            "And so now he is at another hospital where some poor terrified nurse has to care for him. Lock him up in full  restraints in jail in solidarity confinement . This is an animal. The nurse will have permanent problems from this even if she does not lose her eyesight. When she clocked into work she planned to work her shift , care for her patients and return home to her loved one unharmed. Your day at work should never land you in ICU fighting for your life . This poor woman her sense of security, self and the world is forever changed. She will never be the same woman who reported for duty yesterday. Her Co workers must be so shaken. She is not fine , They are not fine. Every nurse will carry a little fear when she/he enters a patient room. We are not punching bags . It is not OK to abuse us in anyway . When I was working we received annual training on how to de escalate a volatile situation. It was made clear that we should never protect ourselves. At the time I worked in an outpatient area . If a patient attacked me I would have defended myself if necessary and have pressed charges to the full extent of the law. My life was service but abuse toward health care workers is totally unacceptable always . This guy was mental but he gets no free pass there needs to be measures in place to protect the care givers as well as the clients.",

I got goosebumps, because there stood a man, talking into all the issues we are dealing with. It\u00b4s time for EU leaders to wake up and do the right thing, and make Europe great again.

            "Louis, as a proud member of the Woke Mob I am quite revolted by the prospect of changing an existing copy of a published text without the owner&#39;s (or the author&#39;s) consent.  This form of sanitization only serves distributors&#39; interests - it is NOT how we woke types do productive discourse about bias in writing.  As you said, it compromises the historicity of any analysis.  In fact it&#39;s literally worse than doing nothing because when you excise the most obvious, superficial signs of bigotry from a text you&#39;re obviously still left with the underlying attitudes, now with more implied normalcy, modernity, and plausible endorsement from the platform.  A company abusing their DRM and the integrity of their texts like this does not give a shit about progressive critique of fiction, they are only maintaining whatever the commercially safe level of respectability happens to be at the time.  You don&#39;t &quot;fix&quot; a work and pretend you can just represent it as the &quot;good&quot; parts - it doesn&#39;t work that way.  You take it as the complete piece it is, and you bring context into the way you read it, you bring a critical eye - you know, all the things readers are supposed to be getting out of literacy in the first place.  It feels inherently commercial to me to want to take the work out of its context, like they want to be able to trade on the famous title and pretend it has less objectionable content than it does, rather than promoting any lesser-known works with actually better politics as alternatives.",

            "Hey Alec, as a professional metallurgist working in a heat treat plant, your varying hardness results are coming from your quench. High carbon steels generate a case when oil quenched, caused by the transformation of the austenite to martensite crystal structures as it cools down. This transformation needs to happen extremely quickly, on the order of 0.5-5 seconds depending on the alloy, otherwise the carbon has time to move around too much and find where it wants to be. This means that you generally only get high hardness right on the surface, as the core cant cool fast enough to transform into martensite. This case is usually only 0.010-0.060&quot; deep, the rest of the core will be much lower.<br>Inconsistant agitation or slowly lowering the piece into the oil will also lead to differing hardnesses across the part, because the part heats up the oil surrounding it which reduces the oils ability to remove the heat from the steel. The more oil you have in your container, the better, and most professional quench tanks have internal impellers or recirculation to make sure that the oil right next to the part is always being replaced by cooler new oil.<br>Awesome job as always, excited to see more!"

I might do carnivore every now and again as well the BBBE challenge. Holidays are a little rough but for the most part I eat well. I do not use bad oils. But I have had hypertension since I was 18 and I am now 54. I have been medicated on four different blood pressure medications for most of those years. Since going on keto, I was able to cut them in half. Yet recently, my blood pressure started climbing, even while adding back a pill that I had said goodbye to. Long story short I needed the electrolytes. And I know this because I started making my own electrolytes with magnesium chloride, potassium, and Redmond salt. I had been using keto drops, but they weren\u2019t working enough for me. So making my own, I was able to control how much of everything I put in. I also was able to Take every blood pressure pill and cut it in half and hoping to continue to reduce them because now my pressure is normal again. Sometimes it really is your electrolytes that are off even if you are eating a lot of meat. I don\u2019t know why. And I don\u2019t understand the reason I have hypertension to begin with except that it runs in my family.Just wanted to share this in case it helps someone. I bought all of my ingredients off Amazon."

            "Honey I\u2019m 62 &amp; cook on cast iron daily since I was 10. I use cast iron pans that are from the late 1800\u2019s &amp; early 1900\u2019s all Griswald Wagner &amp; lodge (1950\u2019s) . These cast iron was made in Ohio both companies bought out by lodge. I\u2019m guessing your pans were not completely dry when you stored them. Now the sticky oily residue is from spraying your pans with non stick Pam or avocado or olive oils. Use Lard or Tallow even crisco only &amp; grease the pans &amp; lids up really good. You can use soap if necessary. Once you start using these they will be nonstick &amp; stay beautiful. I don\u2019t cook acidic  foods in mine. I have every size made.  I have 3 complete sets to pass down to each daughter &amp; granddaughter. Thanks Becky for sharing. GOD BLESS from Central Indiana Farmland",
            "Thats the magic of Becky..... NEVER in a million years did I ever think I would spend an hour watching someone cleaning pans...but hey, she has you in her grip, Well done Becky. Great job done."

            "Hi Dr Campbell, I have followed your channel since 2020 and always find your videos informative and interesting. I am a retired NHS Biomedical scientist and have performed Vitamin D analysis in the past. It used to be a very expensive test, so was rationed to those patients in the highest need. However, since I retired, I believe the testing of Vit D has moved to a more automated methodology and may be cheaper to do. It may still be worth a chat to your GP to see if they are willing to do it at your local hospital. With respect, the test that you were using on your video, would not be acceptable in a medical laboratory, NHS or Private, (at least, not in my day!) These home testing kits can be hit and miss in my experience. If I may offer a suggestion, it would be to get a blood test done by an accredited laboratory, even if you have to have one privately, before you up the Vit D dosage, then you could confirm the test kit was accurate or not, it would also confirm that you are taking the correct amount of Vit D or not. If you up your dose and then use a different kit you still won&#39;t know which one made the difference. I take 6000iu a day of D with a meal containing fat or a glass of whole milk to improve absorption. I haven&#39;t had my levels checked but I seem to be avoiding all the respiratory illnesses that are afflicting my friends and family, so, fingers crossed. Thanks for all the work you do - you are one of the good guys."

I have imagined this is because the topic is still considered &quot;women&#39;s work&quot; (whether this is conscious or not).

            "Before you go tearing your car apart thinking you have this problem, check the plastic clip in the trunk that holds the tension rods (not really sure what you call them) in the rear deck.  I had a 2015 Camry XSE with a sunroof and whenever the body flexed and twisted like Amd described, there was a very loud pop/bang that was difficult to localize where it was coming from.  Sometimes it sounded like it was coming from the sunroof, other times the right rear suspension.  The sound is solid and travels through the entire body of the car.  I fought it for weeks by myself, then finally had my father-in-law drive the car while I sat in different areas to try and find the source.  I ended up riding in the trunk and found it.  A small, stupid plastic clip under the rear deck was allowing those metal rods to flex and pop.  Check that first as it&#39;s much easier and cheaper to fix.  Toyota part# 64127-06110 for years 2015-2018.",

After researching on the Internet, I finally found the bulletin.   And, after reading it, I decided this is going to be somebody else\u2019s problem to fix.   But in the meantime, I decided the best way for me to get relief was to take the dip out of my driveway.  This clock is really the biggest disappointment in my 2017 Camry.   Love your channel."

It&#39;s not about the kill it&#39;s about the hunt and the experience. Im seeing hunting changing to killing instead of hunting in the last several  years. Especially with this big interest in long range sniping game. Keep the good content coming guys.",

            "Should be very proud of Bear on the shot he didn&#39;t take \ud83d\ude0a <br><br>Even if his concerns weren&#39;t relevant due to the change in equipment the fact is he didn&#39;t feel confident taking the shot for it to be humane and so showed great disapline even when under pressure plus the pressure of Clay telling him to take it.<br><br>Much better to miss a good shot opportunity due to being too cautious then to land bad shots due to impulse."

On that one, there&#39;s too many patches of different shapes, sizes, orientations, and colors, leaving it feeling chaotic and busy."

            "During my first marathon preparation for Valencia, I experienced severe shin pain 4\u20136 weeks prior to the event. Two weeks before the race, I ceased running, hoping to recover by race day on December 1st. I didn\u2019t seek a diagnosis or imaging because I didn\u2019t want to believe it was a fracture that would prevent me from racing.<br><br>On race day, I chose to compete and aimed for a sub-3-hour finish in my first marathon. Ibuprofen and adrenaline masked the pain. At 30 km, I was still on pace but realized I had caused significant damage. I finished in 3 hours flat, later discovering I had sustained a grade 4 fracture in my leg.<br><br>After the race, my leg was incredibly swollen, and I couldn\u2019t walk properly for a few weeks. Following this, I stopped running. It\u2019s been 10 weeks with no pain at rest or while walking. I decided to get an MRI to establish a comeback plan, which confirmed a grade 4 (severe) fracture.<br><br>And now we\u2019re here.<br><br>Time to create a build-back plan.<br><br>Moral of the story:<br><br>Do not run through pain. It\u2019s not tough; it\u2019s stupid.",

Great video as allways.<br>My grandfather is a retired electrical engineer and had experience with many of these systems through Vinnova (the swedish ministry for innovation, back then it was called STU)! He also mentioned other early Swedish systems that were important at the time like the Cencor 908, developed by Stansab in J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, which was used very early on for building airport traffic management systems. The Cencor 908 was especially interesting since it ended up causing an international incident in the early 1970s when Stansab sold one of the aforementioned traffic management systems to the Moscow airport. This was problematic not only because we had given a system that could easily be repurposed for military use to the USSR but also because there were bans on exporting many of the advanced and sensitive American made components in the Cencor 908 to the USSR. Both the swedish and american governments were apparently quite upset at Stansab because of this....."

We can see what is happening in the US and where it is headed very quickly.  We have the power of the wallet.  The wealthy, powerful people in the US care only about $$. If we can make them feel financial pain, we can push them to influence the government to change course.  We can protect ourselves and our democracies as well as Americans who did not vote for this fascist regime.  Individually, we can not do much, but we can make a difference if we stand together.  Power comes in numbers too big to ignore. Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you will pass the message on in your communities.

An order later, i opened my back door and.. saw his order. I was so confused why it was there. I remembered everything about going there and taking the picture.<br>He said I was never on his cameras.. Appearantly i hallucinated the whole delivery. I was there, but must of never left the car or even drove up..<br><br> What was i doing then?? Staring blankly at the windshield?

I think it is really interesting that your favourite baskets are mostly WILLOW. Many years ago we were stationed in Germany for five years and before I was fluent in the language, I took a willow weaving course in my little village\u2026\u2026.we ended up with about fifteen different baskets and I was hooked!!!",
