It will give you about 2 more inches for deficit movement, without having to strain your neck back . Also reduces the strain on your wrists since they are at a more severe angle than normal. With the foam yoga blocks, you won&#39;t hurt your knuckles. 2) If you do this at home, do it in front of the stairs. You can adjust the angle by changing which stair tread you use. 3) Use a weight vest for overloading. Once you do this for a while, you&#39;ll start blowing out the # of reps and will need to increase the load to keep seeing growth. You can use the vest for overloading a lot of other body weight exercises too, like squats.",
