It will give you about 2 more inches for deficit movement, without having to strain your neck back . Also reduces the strain on your wrists since they are at a more severe angle than normal. With the foam yoga blocks, you won&#39;t hurt your knuckles. 2) If you do this at home, do it in front of the stairs. You can adjust the angle by changing which stair tread you use. 3) Use a weight vest for overloading. Once you do this for a while, you&#39;ll start blowing out the # of reps and will need to increase the load to keep seeing growth. You can use the vest for overloading a lot of other body weight exercises too, like squats.",

            "Interesting, but what is the point. Even if we discover a planet with life on it what do we do with this information? It will likely be many hundreds or thousands of light years away, so we can only attempt to send a message to them which will take hundreds, or thousands of years to get a reply. The truth is we probably aren&#39;t alone, but the vastness of space and current technology means that we essentially are."

The only difference comes when measuring by volume (like teaspoons) because kosher salt&#39;s larger flakes take up more space. 1 tsp of fine salt holds more crystals than 1 tsp of kosher salt, so you&#39;d get more sodium that way. But if you&#39;re weighing your salt (which is more accurate for baking!), 100g of either salt will give you the same sodium content. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPUux4h4Mf8&amp;t=304\">5:04</a>"

            "Bro, go to settings and click on initial tune parameters enter prop size and battery type, if you are using mission planner. I recommend mission planner. Reduce p , I , d (keep p and i equal)  of both roll and pitch till you get a stable hover in stabilize flight mode. Better use a telemetry radio instead of connecting a laptop to it every time. Reduce p and I in larger steps than D. All these value can be found in extended tuning tab of mission planner. Now once you get a stable hover , switch to althold with mot_thst_hover param set to 2. Disable it after a 30 second flight by changing the parameter to 0. Plug in the hover learn value into throttle to accel gains p= hover learn, I = 2*hover learn, then takeoff in althold and switch to loiter. If everything is fine, you can proceed with autotune. Don&#39;t use dampers for autopilot, it already has two IMUs damped internally. Square tubes (motor arms) can cause vibration because of pulse from the propeller,  passing over it , better use a round pipe or try notch filtering. Probably, you can&#39;t autotune it if the flight time is very less.",

I would like to encourage you to buy any property adjacent to yours if you can afford it. Encroachment is a real problem in many places and the only way to avoid it is to buy the property as it becomes available. If you don&#39;t then the people that get it might start complaining about you.  Too much noise, too much dust, too much smoke, too many trucks,  etc. And if you decide to get livestock then there is the smell. The only way to protect yourself is to separate yourself from the complaining.  You&#39;ve got a good thing going going and I and many others enjoy watching. Hang in there.",

            "TIP:   When &quot;trimming&quot; the edge guide of a new saw (or replacement), do not put it OVER the edge of the wood.  Instead, find a scrap piece, and make an actual cut... trimming the edge guide in the process.  This gives you a much cleaner and more accurate edge.<br><br>Or, maybe that&#39;s just with the cheaper track saws... haven&#39;t been able to afford an expensive one LOL",
            "The reason that Makita doesn&#39;t seem as exciting as other tool brands comes down to their core culture as a high quality Japanese tool company.  They don&#39;t rush into anything, they don&#39;t jump on bandwagons, and they don&#39;t release anything until they think it is ready.  This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t make mistakes, or that they don&#39;t occasionally miss the mark; but it does mean that their build quality is top notch and when they do release a new tool, it is often a game changer in that tool class.  The flip side is that they release a new model every 7-10 years instead of every 2 years.  They take that time to study how the tool is used and how it breaks so that the next one is better.  I appreciate that they don&#39;t try to make the most powerful tool, they try to make the best tool for the job and job rating.  Sure, you can take a Milwaukee and push it till it screams and it will most often the most powerful version of that tool, but it will tear itself apart while doing that. A Makita will just shut off if you start asking it to do something it isn&#39;t intended to do.  On their impact wrenches people often complain that you can&#39;t slap a too big socket on it and blow it to bits, but the makita will just shut down and tell you &quot;go get a bigger wrench that is meant for this bulldozer, I&#39;m designed for a civic&quot;."

            "Son. I turn 42 tomorrow and as a kid helmets and life vests never existed . We came home everyday scraped up, scaled up and laughin about it every day . I grew up my entire life in Clearwater beach Florida.  Fishing, huntin, 4 wheelin. You got hurt ment you had some fun. Dad always said two things. What did you lear , and then walk it off. I love how your raising your boys. It\u2019s how we were raised and how kids should still be raised. My oldest daughter who is twenty is half and half. Half girly but ain\u2019t afraid to get dirty, my 9 year old daughter ain\u2019t girly at all and is all tomboy. She\u2019s my feral child. Won\u2019t wear shoes, catchin bugs outside all day, always wants to go fishin. Bring back our generation and teach them right.",

            "It makes me feel so many positive feelings in the wake of your not only mentioning helmets for the boys, but telling them the plan to acquire said helmets in the near future.

When you get home you feel like you rode a hard tail sportster down a pothole pocked dirt mountain road!! Plus the silica dust is a keillor!! Definitely no fun over 40!! Those guys are beasties pounding those chipping hammers all day. Can&#39;t get those muscles at a gym, never felt a grip like a Mason, thin wiry Iron Muscle, crush your hand like a daisy, hands are hard like dried leather. Much respect and admiration to all working on this one, I will admit I&#39;m just a little jealous, this is a beautiful example of how to do it right, even if it costs you a bit of time. In the end the timeless structure will last long after we are all gone.  That is what I love most about restoration, bringing it back from the brink and making it shine once again for future generations to enjoy.",

            "I worked as a CNA for a while, and me and one of my patients decided to play a prank on the dour old nurse on duty. The patient had a catheter, so I hid the bag on the back of the chair. I got a new catheter bag and filled it up with white grape juice, then strapped it to her leg (she was in on it, and wanted to do it) just like a normal catheter. When the nurse came in to assess her for the am meds, I pretended like I was emptying the catheter into a brand new measuring cylinder. After draining the very uriney-looking juice into the container, I stood there chatting up the nurse, and then casually just started taking sips... <br><br>She didn&#39;t notice the first one, but the second time her eyes went wide and she shrieked &quot;what the hell are you doing?!!&quot; By then, the patient was convulsing with silent  laughter. <br><br>We also had a young guy who was paralyzed, but alert and responsive. I asked him if he wanted to play a prank on the oncoming night shift girl, and he nodded yes, and grinned. He was pretty big, so I usually had him in bed and squared away before she came on. That night, I pushed his chair into the bathroom like usual, but left him in it and threw a sheet over him, tucked just to the side so he was hidden, but could still see what was happening. I then went and laid down in his bed and covered myself with the sheet, and put my limbs in the position he was usually stuck in. <br><br>When she came in to check on him, she pulled the sheet back and I jumped out. She screamed so loud half of the administration came running down from the nurse&#39;s station to see what was wrong. The guy was in the corner laughing his head off and grinning from ear to ear.

            "As a risk of rain 2 (and other rougelikes) fan I have to say I REALLY dislike the fact that majority of the artifacts have huge downsides, risk of rain has it where all of the regular items give you flat buffs and only special items (Lunars) give you both a positive and negative, however, the positive and negative combine to completely alter the gameplay: for example stone flux pauldron doubles your health but halves your movement speed. The way the downsides cripple OTHER towers seems so backwards to me, I understand how it\u2019s trying to get you to only use that tower or similar towers but I feel like it should where it strengthens a tower in one way but nerfs that same tower in a different way to change how you use that single tower building more opportunities for synergies between towers with new and cool ways to use each of them (also making an opening for more artifact diversity)",

If I was rich, this is something I would have fixed for her. But like most Americans, I\u2019m barely getting by.",

When I tell you we service cars like this all the time I am not exaggerating. Pretty much every 5 cars is similar to this or other very dirty ones you&#39;ve covered. It has been helpful to see your work and inspirational to me. I have started to lose the happiness for my job that I first had because of the specific nature of everything going on in the work place that out of professionality I will refrain from discussing.

It&#39;s really important to tell the lab to try their best to get them flat in order mitigate this. The second tip is to use 50% opacity and &quot;invert&quot; in photoshop to correctly align the focal point. After shooting over 100 rolls thru a Nimslo in the poundland glory days I came up with this and you can edit a whole roll in 5-10 mins when they&#39;re not warped :) Never seen this cam before tho, looks gorgeous!",

And when they do actually do something with them, they feel bad, confused or wrong because it requires a lot of technique. It humbles your ego. It takes time to understand and learn. That&#39;s not so much the case for your standard dumbbells. If you want to get into kettlebells, you gotta be willing to learn and start light. You have to take the time to actually master the technique and go through the motions, even if you&#39;re experienced when it comes to fitness. Kettlebells are an incredibly unique, versatile, and fun tool. Kettlebells are awesome and are no more dangerous than standard weightlifting, in fact, I&#39;d argue the movements are far less dangerous than your average barbell squat or bench press."

            "Hey brother, retired fire inspector here. You are very lucky that you didn&#39;t lose your home to fire. Oily stain type finishes and even cooking oil stained rags  have a known history of self ignition when balled up and packed in a bag or other combustible container. I remember a fire destroyed a million dollar home 2 or 3 weeks before the owners moved in. The flooring contractor was staining real wood floors and trim. His uninformed workers balled up the old stained rags and thew them in a corner. During the night they generated heat , ignited and burned the home down. A metal container for those with a tight lid can usually keep that from happening but I used to tell people to take that can outside and away from the house until they are ready for proper disposal. You can always get more rags pretty cheap. This spontaneous heating phenomenon through oxidation is very real.",

My dad would always reassure her that the cabin was 60 years old and the beam was not going to break.

            "As someone who has made a tradition of eating Orville Movie Theater Butter popcorn while watching movies with my son, I have discovered that the amount of time the popcorn spends in the microwave is critical to its flavor. Waiting until there are 3 or 4 seconds between pops can often take quite a while after the majority of the kernels have already popped, and that leads to not only the slightly burned flavor, but it absolutely kills the butter flavor as well. You get a far better flavor by stopping the microwave a little early and dealing with a few more unpopped kernels. It&#39;s amazing the difference only 10 or 20 seconds makes - it&#39;s almost like the butter flavor boils off.",

The topic was needless to say, controversial. Sponsor after sponsor started dropping out until they nearly ended up canceling the project, only Orville Redenbacher remained as a sponsor. The prime time premiere featured only popcorn ads for the first half and the final part of the movie was shown uninterrupted. It went on to be the most successful made for TV movie of all time. Ronald Regan received an early screening and his diaries say that watching <b>The Day After</b> convinced him that nuclear war couldn&#39;t be won."

            "Long time listener. First time caller.<br>In our town 7-3/4 is max stair rise. You can also cheat the total rise down, creating a slight pitch to the treads for further savings on the total run.<br><br>I find 8&quot; a bit tall for rise height personally.<br><br>Enjoying your content, thanks!",
            "The only thing about the stairs you may not have (or maybe did?) take into account is if your stairs are not up to code (especially if intentional) and someone injures themselves on them, insurance may not cover you.  Since this is a rental/AirBnB, this could be a massive legal and financial liability. Especially since these videos are in the public domain and you have admitted on more than one occasion that you are only using the current stairs &quot;to fool the code inspectors&quot; or to &quot;pass code&quot;.  Protect yourself, your family, and your future as a Youtuber, please.",
            "In Europe we use something called the &quot;stair formula&quot;. The rule is that &quot;2x riser height plus 1x tread depth equals 65 cm / 26 inch&quot; (which is the length of a human step). This means that you can make stairs as steep as you want, but when the riser height increases, the tread depth has to decrease accordingly. Applying this rule will result in comfortable stairs, no matter how lazy or steep.<br>The way you typically use this formula is that you take the distance from floor to floor, divide it by the number of steps (an integer value) which gives you the riser height. Then use the stair formula to determine the tread depth.<br>For example when the floor to floor height is 10 foot (120 inch) you can do 15 treads (the upper floor counts as one), resulting in a riser height of 8&quot; and therefore a tread depth of 10&quot;. But for a steeper stair (maybe space is limited) you can decrease the number of treads to 12 where each step has a rise of 10&quot; and a tread depth of 6&quot;. Both examples will work well, but the second one is getting close to a ladder. Of course when you need things like 11 or 13 steps, going metric and using a calculator makes this all much easier.<br>I&#39;ve never seen this rule applied in North America. But especially outside sidewalks have often horrible stairs that make you stumble."
