It will give you about 2 more inches for deficit movement, without having to strain your neck back . Also reduces the strain on your wrists since they are at a more severe angle than normal. With the foam yoga blocks, you won&#39;t hurt your knuckles. 2) If you do this at home, do it in front of the stairs. You can adjust the angle by changing which stair tread you use. 3) Use a weight vest for overloading. Once you do this for a while, you&#39;ll start blowing out the # of reps and will need to increase the load to keep seeing growth. You can use the vest for overloading a lot of other body weight exercises too, like squats.",

            "When measured by weight (like in grams or ounces), fine sea salt and kosher salt have the same sodium content since they&#39;re both just sodium chloride (NaCl). The only difference comes when measuring by volume (like teaspoons) because kosher salt&#39;s larger flakes take up more space. 1 tsp of fine salt holds more crystals than 1 tsp of kosher salt, so you&#39;d get more sodium that way. But if you&#39;re weighing your salt (which is more accurate for baking!), 100g of either salt will give you the same sodium content. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPUux4h4Mf8&amp;t=304\">5:04</a>"

            "Bro, go to settings and click on initial tune parameters enter prop size and battery type, if you are using mission planner. I recommend mission planner. Reduce p , I , d (keep p and i equal)  of both roll and pitch till you get a stable hover in stabilize flight mode. Better use a telemetry radio instead of connecting a laptop to it every time. Reduce p and I in larger steps than D. All these value can be found in extended tuning tab of mission planner. Now once you get a stable hover , switch to althold with mot_thst_hover param set to 2. Disable it after a 30 second flight by changing the parameter to 0. Plug in the hover learn value into throttle to accel gains p= hover learn, I = 2*hover learn, then takeoff in althold and switch to loiter. If everything is fine, you can proceed with autotune. Don&#39;t use dampers for autopilot, it already has two IMUs damped internally. Square tubes (motor arms) can cause vibration because of pulse from the propeller,  passing over it , better use a round pipe or try notch filtering. Probably, you can&#39;t autotune it if the flight time is very less.",

I would like to encourage you to buy any property adjacent to yours if you can afford it. Encroachment is a real problem in many places and the only way to avoid it is to buy the property as it becomes available. If you don&#39;t then the people that get it might start complaining about you.  Too much noise, too much dust, too much smoke, too many trucks,  etc. And if you decide to get livestock then there is the smell. The only way to protect yourself is to separate yourself from the complaining.  You&#39;ve got a good thing going going and I and many others enjoy watching. Hang in there.",

            "TIP:   When &quot;trimming&quot; the edge guide of a new saw (or replacement), do not put it OVER the edge of the wood.  Instead, find a scrap piece, and make an actual cut... trimming the edge guide in the process.  This gives you a much cleaner and more accurate edge.<br><br>Or, maybe that&#39;s just with the cheaper track saws... haven&#39;t been able to afford an expensive one LOL",
            "The reason that Makita doesn&#39;t seem as exciting as other tool brands comes down to their core culture as a high quality Japanese tool company.  They don&#39;t rush into anything, they don&#39;t jump on bandwagons, and they don&#39;t release anything until they think it is ready.  This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t make mistakes, or that they don&#39;t occasionally miss the mark; but it does mean that their build quality is top notch and when they do release a new tool, it is often a game changer in that tool class.  The flip side is that they release a new model every 7-10 years instead of every 2 years.  They take that time to study how the tool is used and how it breaks so that the next one is better.  I appreciate that they don&#39;t try to make the most powerful tool, they try to make the best tool for the job and job rating.  Sure, you can take a Milwaukee and push it till it screams and it will most often the most powerful version of that tool, but it will tear itself apart while doing that. A Makita will just shut off if you start asking it to do something it isn&#39;t intended to do.  On their impact wrenches people often complain that you can&#39;t slap a too big socket on it and blow it to bits, but the makita will just shut down and tell you &quot;go get a bigger wrench that is meant for this bulldozer, I&#39;m designed for a civic&quot;."

            "Son. I turn 42 tomorrow and as a kid helmets and life vests never existed . We came home everyday scraped up, scaled up and laughin about it every day . I grew up my entire life in Clearwater beach Florida.  Fishing, huntin, 4 wheelin. You got hurt ment you had some fun. Dad always said two things. What did you lear , and then walk it off. I love how your raising your boys. It\u2019s how we were raised and how kids should still be raised. My oldest daughter who is twenty is half and half. Half girly but ain\u2019t afraid to get dirty, my 9 year old daughter ain\u2019t girly at all and is all tomboy. She\u2019s my feral child. Won\u2019t wear shoes, catchin bugs outside all day, always wants to go fishin. Bring back our generation and teach them right.",

            "It makes me feel so many positive feelings in the wake of your not only mentioning helmets for the boys, but telling them the plan to acquire said helmets in the near future.

When you get home you feel like you rode a hard tail sportster down a pothole pocked dirt mountain road!! Plus the silica dust is a keillor!! Definitely no fun over 40!! Those guys are beasties pounding those chipping hammers all day. Can&#39;t get those muscles at a gym, never felt a grip like a Mason, thin wiry Iron Muscle, crush your hand like a daisy, hands are hard like dried leather. Much respect and admiration to all working on this one, I will admit I&#39;m just a little jealous, this is a beautiful example of how to do it right, even if it costs you a bit of time. In the end the timeless structure will last long after we are all gone.  That is what I love most about restoration, bringing it back from the brink and making it shine once again for future generations to enjoy.",

            "I worked as a CNA for a while, and me and one of my patients decided to play a prank on the dour old nurse on duty. The patient had a catheter, so I hid the bag on the back of the chair. I got a new catheter bag and filled it up with white grape juice, then strapped it to her leg (she was in on it, and wanted to do it) just like a normal catheter. When the nurse came in to assess her for the am meds, I pretended like I was emptying the catheter into a brand new measuring cylinder. After draining the very uriney-looking juice into the container, I stood there chatting up the nurse, and then casually just started taking sips... <br><br>She didn&#39;t notice the first one, but the second time her eyes went wide and she shrieked &quot;what the hell are you doing?!!&quot; By then, the patient was convulsing with silent  laughter. <br><br>We also had a young guy who was paralyzed, but alert and responsive. I asked him if he wanted to play a prank on the oncoming night shift girl, and he nodded yes, and grinned. He was pretty big, so I usually had him in bed and squared away before she came on. That night, I pushed his chair into the bathroom like usual, but left him in it and threw a sheet over him, tucked just to the side so he was hidden, but could still see what was happening. I then went and laid down in his bed and covered myself with the sheet, and put my limbs in the position he was usually stuck in. <br><br>When she came in to check on him, she pulled the sheet back and I jumped out. She screamed so loud half of the administration came running down from the nurse&#39;s station to see what was wrong. The guy was in the corner laughing his head off and grinning from ear to ear.

            "As a risk of rain 2 (and other rougelikes) fan I have to say I REALLY dislike the fact that majority of the artifacts have huge downsides, risk of rain has it where all of the regular items give you flat buffs and only special items (Lunars) give you both a positive and negative, however, the positive and negative combine to completely alter the gameplay: for example stone flux pauldron doubles your health but halves your movement speed. The way the downsides cripple OTHER towers seems so backwards to me, I understand how it\u2019s trying to get you to only use that tower or similar towers but I feel like it should where it strengthens a tower in one way but nerfs that same tower in a different way to change how you use that single tower building more opportunities for synergies between towers with new and cool ways to use each of them (also making an opening for more artifact diversity)",

Saw a lady a few weeks ago who had a very run down small car with a broken back window. We live in Oregon where it rains most of the year. She had a newborn and toddler car seat in the back. If I was rich, this is something I would have fixed for her. But like most Americans, I\u2019m barely getting by.",

When I tell you we service cars like this all the time I am not exaggerating. Pretty much every 5 cars is similar to this or other very dirty ones you&#39;ve covered. It has been helpful to see your work and inspirational to me. I have started to lose the happiness for my job that I first had because of the specific nature of everything going on in the work place that out of professionality I will refrain from discussing. Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s less than desirable but I still try to be grateful and work with what I have. Anyways your videos have reignited my passion for detailing so just wanna say thankyou!"

It&#39;s really important to tell the lab to try their best to get them flat in order mitigate this. The second tip is to use 50% opacity and &quot;invert&quot; in photoshop to correctly align the focal point. After shooting over 100 rolls thru a Nimslo in the poundland glory days I came up with this and you can edit a whole roll in 5-10 mins when they&#39;re not warped :) Never seen this cam before tho, looks gorgeous!",

            "Hey brother, retired fire inspector here. You are very lucky that you didn&#39;t lose your home to fire. Oily stain type finishes and even cooking oil stained rags  have a known history of self ignition when balled up and packed in a bag or other combustible container. I remember a fire destroyed a million dollar home 2 or 3 weeks before the owners moved in. The flooring contractor was staining real wood floors and trim. His uninformed workers balled up the old stained rags and thew them in a corner. During the night they generated heat , ignited and burned the home down.

I love getting to watch how your brain works at overcoming supply and materials issues, logistics of massive projects, etc. You were absolutely meant to do this. Never ever stop my friend.",

            "As someone who has made a tradition of eating Orville Movie Theater Butter popcorn while watching movies with my son, I have discovered that the amount of time the popcorn spends in the microwave is critical to its flavor. Waiting until there are 3 or 4 seconds between pops can often take quite a while after the majority of the kernels have already popped, and that leads to not only the slightly burned flavor, but it absolutely kills the butter flavor as well. You get a far better flavor by stopping the microwave a little early and dealing with a few more unpopped kernels. It&#39;s amazing the difference only 10 or 20 seconds makes - it&#39;s almost like the butter flavor boils off.",

Especially since these videos are in the public domain and you have admitted on more than one occasion that you are only using the current stairs &quot;to fool the code inspectors&quot; or to &quot;pass code&quot;.  Protect yourself, your family, and your future as a Youtuber, please.",
            "In Europe we use something called the &quot;stair formula&quot;. The rule is that &quot;2x riser height plus 1x tread depth equals 65 cm / 26 inch&quot; (which is the length of a human step). This means that you can make stairs as steep as you want, but when the riser height increases, the tread depth has to decrease accordingly. Applying this rule will result in comfortable stairs, no matter how lazy or steep.<br>The way you typically use this formula is that you take the distance from floor to floor, divide it by the number of steps (an integer value) which gives you the riser height. Then use the stair formula to determine the tread depth.<br>For example when the floor to floor height is 10 foot (120 inch) you can do 15 treads (the upper floor counts as one), resulting in a riser height of 8&quot; and therefore a tread depth of 10&quot;. But for a steeper stair (maybe space is limited) you can decrease the number of treads to 12 where each step has a rise of 10&quot; and a tread depth of 6&quot;. Both examples will work well, but the second one is getting close to a ladder. Of course when you need things like 11 or 13 steps, going metric and using a calculator makes this all much easier.<br>I&#39;ve never seen this rule applied in North America. But especially outside sidewalks have often horrible stairs that make you stumble."

He took part in the rescues of the 86 survivors picked up by Dorsetshire, before the rescue efforts had to be abandoned. One of the men he helped onboard, a member of turret &quot;Dora&#39;s&quot; gun house crew named Friedrich Junghans, gave dad his &quot;erkennungsmarke&quot; or dogtag in gratitude. Post war dad tried to return the dogtag to Friedrich but was unable to trace him. He later found out that Friedrich had died in Los Angeles USA in 1973, so in 1993 dad donated Friedrich&#39;s dogtag to the &quot;Merseyside Maritime Museum&quot; in Liverpool UK where it is still on display to this day.",

I saw him on remembrance Sunday wearing his RAF gear and some medals, I recognised most but not one that was huge and shiny, he told me it was, &quot;A coffee tin lid&quot;. I found out later where he got it. After spending time flying Lancasters he was swapped to teaching Poles how to fly, he said it was the scariest thing he ever did because they HATED the NAZI, (quite understandably I thought) and would fly at them no matter what. It was quite the statement considering he won the medal, which was Polish, for flying Polish spies into occupied Poland in a little Lysander aircraft. Thank you for reminding me of my friend."

            "As a dental professional of 25 years we see younger and younger kids asking about teeth bleaching when it really isn&#39;t necessary all because society says you have to have insanely white teeth that look like tic tacs.  Can we normalise naturally white teeth which can have a very slightly yellowish hue, which is totally NORMAL?  I talk more people out of bleaching to save their money than to promote it, the exposure to social media and people constantly seeing influencers and celebrities with bad veneers and crowns which are very unnatural and insanely white.  I have had to pull out the shade guide and they are always surprised when I show them how white their teeth actually are.<br>Normal brushing/flossing and low staining foods with a hygiene appointment every 6 months is sufficient, imo.  It does make me sad to hear young children asking about bleaching when they have naturally white teeth already, societal &#39;norms&#39; are changing and there are a lot of dentist making money from people being insecure about their natural coloured teeth.",
            "As a dental assistant, you&#39;re spot on! Another thing I would add to reduce sensitivity is not <b>just</b> brush with Sensodyne (or any equivalent with potassium nitrate) but after brushing, get a paper towel, dry your teeth, then rub some Sensodyne on them. Concentrate on the areas you&#39;re most sensitive - gum recession, etc. Leave it on for like 10 min then spit it out. We tell our patients to do this every day at least 2 weeks before starting any whitening treatment, as well as in between sessions.",
            "You changed my life in a positive way Dr. Idriss. I have been following you for 2 years and pretty much followed all of your advice - from skincare to hair and now teeth. It took about two years - but today people ask me what I did to look so young for 60 years old. The answer now (after all these treatment) is too long to explain. It is a full time job - but I love it. Thank you, thank you and thank you for your devotion and thoroughness in explaining to us the various options. You are my hero!"

My dessert is always Greek Yogurt with dark unsweetened chocolate and a teaspoon of Allulose. My proteins are ground beef, sardines, salmon, and very rarely chicken for a change of pace. I will add a sweet potato or chickpea pasta in for a day if I get too cold (I get cold on Keto). I currently weigh 170lbs - ripped to shreds. I walk my dogs daily for exercise and once a week weight workout. I did not have to do a lot of cardio. I take a multi, CoQ10, &amp; Magnesium daily as supplements. I had open heart surgery 3 years ago to replace my aortic valve. I had a 5mm hole in it due to endocarditis. I also have Hemochromatosis which has damaged my liver with fibrosis. I require quarterly blood treatments for the rest of my life. After each treatment I eat liver to bring my hemoglobin back up. I found slow smoking the liver on the grill with onion &amp; garlic powder tastes the best to me.",

I\u2019ve learned so much from Paul and this channel, and I\u2019ve been watching since the early days. Still my favorite channel and so happy that you guys are creeping up on 700k subscribers.

            "I felt awful that the beginners were confused in the last video!! I hope this clears it up and helps everyone. Let me know if there is anything you do not understand here.<br><br>Also this video is not referring to offgrid specific inverters! The flex boss is a hybrid inverter running in off-grid mode. The gateway allows you to run hybrid and grid tie inverters, without the grid. I call this &quot;offgrid&quot; because its not connected to grid. Hopefully this does not cause any confusion. Please let me know below if it does.<br><br>A gateway can be called &quot;smart transfer switch&quot; or &quot;micro grid interconnection device&quot; or a host of other names. If it goes between the panel and the meter, it&#39;s all the same. Just a large transfer switch.<br><br>Final update: only EG4 hybrid inverters can connect to the grid boss hybrid ports! You can connect any brand of grid tie inverter to the smart ports, The load terminals of the flexboss, or connect them to your panel. But this is not true for hybrid inverters. It has to be EG4 to work with grid boss hybrid ports",

Obviously, a glass electrode would run the risk of damage or drying out electrolite, so it may seem attractive to try to get PH via Zink pin (video said Stainless steel) It is at best a guess. The NPK isn&#39;t even attempted to be &quot;measured&quot; but is calculated inside of the sensor as a function of the soil EC &amp; guessed pH values. They say &quot;Reference&quot; because these values have basically NO meaning outside of there MAYBE being higher or lower values though this is dubious at best.<br><br>I love your videos, but just wanted to point this out to other before they attempted to invest time or money into something that is basically a random number generator with a builtin Temperature &amp; moisture sensor (the EC values aren&#39;t too bad from our tests though)",

            "As other people have already written, your new USB-C to USB-C cable might be perfectly fine. The problem is that USB-C needs 5.1 kOhm resistors from both CC1 and CC2 to GND to signal to the power source that a device is connected that needs power. I have not seen those resistors in the device. They are usually close to the USB-C port. USB-A to USB-C cables will work fine. The USB-A output port of the power source does not have any CC pins and requires no such resistors. It will use other means to determine the power requirements of connected devices.",

            "Hey Seth. I work at a bike shop in Nebraska and we&#39;re a Specialized dealer and I&#39;m certified as a Turbo mechanic through Specialized. If you haven&#39;t done it already or not aware, bring it to a local Specialized dealer to get a firmware update so that the motor, battery and TCU are properly connected. The Specialized app can do some minor updates but a dealer can do the necessary bigger ones which are needed from time to time. He should also connect the bike to the Specialized app (if he hasn&#39;t already) and it can tell him when those updates are needed and run basic diagnostics. He can also play with the parameters of each level of assist which can maximize battery efficiency based on the riders use of the bike. Very nice work on the bike!!!!"

I would worry about the spray foam staying stuck to the silvered stuff behind. Scoring the silver cover of the backing foam would&#39;ve been a good idea. Also, cutting the shiny surface off the spray foam is done to make a better surface for the cement to bond with. The cement tends to flake off on the uncut surface. The whole thing looks great though. Can&#39;t wait to see the finished product.",

I have a Personal Trainer, use many of his and your exercises and train on average 16 times each calendar month, most at home, two each month with my PT. I have done the exercise in this video, with the slow decent, but not so far with the slow accent  as well.

            "Potato chips, often dismissed as mere junk food, can surprisingly offer some unexpected benefits when consumed in moderation and prepared correctly. While it&#39;s true that conventional chips are often high in unhealthy fats and sodium, opting for baked or air-fried versions can provide a satisfying crunch with less guilt. These healthier alternatives can be a source of quick energy due to their carbohydrate content, and when made with quality oils, they can even contribute to your intake of heart-healthy fats. Additionally, potato chips seasoned with natural herbs and spices can offer antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it&#39;s crucial to balance these potential benefits with the risks of overconsumption, such as weight gain and increased blood pressure, reminding us that moderation is key in enjoying this popular snack.  Like any other food we need to remind ourselves of mindfulness. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "My 17 year old grandson was in a roll over accident that left him as a quadriplegic. He only had control of his body from his head to his shoulders. But not down to his feet. He could move his arm but his fingers were gnarled. His brain functioned normally as he could speak and think. Some times I would sneak into his room at night and find him weeping. This broke my heart to see him looking out the window at other PPL doing what he should have been doing. We talked many a time about things. <br><br>He would say, &quot; grandpa please get me some weed or even a bottle of crown to help ease my emotional pain . At first I would tell him that doesn&#39;t help. But after awhile I could not stand to see him suffer. The alcohol and weed helped him through a lot of pain I knew he was emotionally feeling. <br><br>I&#39;ve been criticized for this on numerous occasions. But I felt his pain and gave him what he wanted. He passed 10 days before his 20th birthday. But he died peacefully after his spinal cord injury. I don&#39;t regret my actions. I was told he would die young by doctors. I know where his Spirit went as we talked about the after life and he gave his heart to the Lord. He has been relieved from his suffering which brings me peace. But I cry a lot as I miss him dearly. But the hope I have is that we will meet again at the resurrection. God rest his soul.",

            "The biggest issue with Beeching was the attitude of BR (and the governments of the time) to the axed lines. It wasn&#39;t enough to just close the lines, they had to be destroyed immediately as well. It was as if they didn&#39;t want to permit the possibility that they could be proved wrong. Track was ripped up and scrapped, no one was allowed to buy lines to operate privately, land was sold for development. This was the greatest error. Deciding to close unprofitable lines was understandable given the way things looked at the time. Making sure they could never be reopened if the world changed was the true crime.",
            "Beeching was commissioned to deliver exactly what the government of the day wanted all along, they wanted a reduction in active railways, and Beeching was the useful &quot;scapegoat&quot; to deflect attention away from the Government to get exactly that.<br><br>If not Beeching, the government would have simply found someone else happy to deliver what they wanted."

Criticism is fair, but issuing death threats or targeting his family, especially his mother, is completely wrong. No one deserves harassment for a mistake. At the same time, this controversy is being given so much attention that it is overshadowing bigger national issues like air pollution, the Manipur crisis, and other serious matters. It feels like the government and media are using this issue to distract people from more pressing problems.<br><br>However, what Ranveer said was completely inappropriate and should not be normalized in any way. Jokes that involve sensitive topics like incest, even in the name of dark humor, are not acceptable in society. Public figures must be careful with their words because their influence is huge. While people should be given a chance to correct their mistakes, we also need to make sure that such comments do not become normal or acceptable in public discourse.",

I would find two or three Funnel Webs every week. They looked dead until you scooped them out and placed them on the deck. After several minutes they would slowly come to life. I would place them in a jar and take them to a nearby ambulance station and they would then send them on to Sydney Wildlife Park where they were milked for their venom to produce antivenom. Caught hundreds over the years I was there.",
            "Lived in Sydney all my life. in 1963 I was helping my dad in the garden and I was bitten by one that I accidentally walked on. 60 years later I can remember the pain on my ankle. By the time I got to hospital I could not feel below my waist. I was put in a coma and woke up 4 days later. No antivenom back then. I was in hospital for two weeks. The reported number of deaths is vastly under reported as stats have only been collected since about 1960. I admire your courage.  And now they have discovered the Big Boy Funnel Web. Its 50% bigger than the one you have there."

            "In this video, I show y&#39;all a 3-In-1 thermal solution that can be a dedicated thermal scope, handheld monocular, &amp; even a thermal clip-on to use with your LPVO. You might be surprised to find out how much they go for. It&#39;s the DNT Hydra and there are 3 models to choose from here: <a href=\"https://us.dntoptics.com/ujhK3z\">https://us.dntoptics.com/ujhK3z</a> The ones featured in this video are the HS225 and HS635. Using code &quot;texasplinking&quot; at checkout, the HS225 goes for $797 and the HS635 goes for $1,998. Watch the video to see which might suit your needs best. <br>I showcased these as clip-ons with the Arken EP8 which is also awesome value. It&#39;s just under $315 using that same code &quot;texasplinking&quot; at checkout here: <a href=\"https://shorturl.at/EFOqj\">https://shorturl.at/EFOqj</a><br>If you don&#39;t plan to use these as clip-ons, I still recommend you consider the ThermNight. Similar to the Hydra but where you lose clip-on mode, you gain a digital day mode, digital night vision, laser rangefinder, and IR light illumination. ThermNight: <a href=\"https://us.dntoptics.com/LpfyVc\">https://us.dntoptics.com/LpfyVc</a><br>Between the Hydra HS225 &amp; HS635, the difference in resolution is noticeable yes, but the biggest difference to me is that minimum magnification of 1.5X. That opens up that field of view much wider which is great for all 3 applications. (Especially for clip-on use) But for under $800, that HS225 is pretty insane! More than usable as a dedicated thermal and clip on no doubt. <br>Thanks for watching!",

But this news is time-sensitive, so I wanted to make a video right now to get the word out. <br><br>Look up Calibre and guides for removing DRM. Look for alternative ereaders. Buy physical media. Support local booksellers.<br><br>EDIT: There are some recurring questions in the comments. I can&#39;t address them all, but here are some thoughts.<br><br>Question: What is DRM?<br><br>DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It is software that limits how you can use a digital asset. It the case of Kindles, DRM locks you into the Kindle ecosystem. It also helps to prevent piracy. This is the crux of the issue: in order to prevent piracy, companies restrict how you can use what you buy. <br><br>Question: Why not just pirate?<br><br>I want to support authors and artists. <br><br>Question: Does this affect your ability to read books on your Kindle or on a Kindle app?<br><br>No. This prevents you from downloading the files onto a folder on your computer, which you can currently do in order to save a local copy (or to use a program like Calibre to strip the DRM). <br><br>Question: Is it legal to remove DRM?<br><br>I am not a lawyer. I said in the video that to the best of my knowledge it was legal (thinking here only about using the content for personal use), but obviously the law is complex and varies by jurisdiction. You&#39;ll want to do your own research before taking any action.",

            "In this video we take a break from our usual &quot;military&quot; discussions and examine the more &quot;civilian&quot; strategy of Roman colonization, which was just as important in maintaining the Empire for centuries! The Romans were great at integrating recently-acquired territory and people into Romans. Creating colonies was just the first step. The many other aspects of Romanization is one of my favorite topics to discuss (despite the absence of military matters) and I will definitely be dedicating a full long video on their other methods, a lot of which are surprisingly still present in our everyday lives... Stay tuned!",

When I give presentations, I like to start out with the Doppler effect explanation and then suddenly ask, &quot;Well, what if it doesn&#39;t make any sound? Does it still make a sonic boom?&quot; And then I give the better explanation (that you gave!) that the sonic boom forms because the air in front can&#39;t get out of the way fast enough, which forms a sudden compression that then propagates away at (very close to) the speed of sound.<br><br> Will be sharing with my colleagues!

I\u2019ve seen trucks with less than 3k with 4+ bearings spun. As for the rods and pistons I have yet to see catastrophic damage like this with such low miles so maybe it was one of those built on a Friday evening engines.

Most of the time, we\u2019re ripping the pan off anyways to get the crank unseized, and that\u2019s far enough for us and GM. Great find and thank you for doing these though, as they\u2019re insightful. I\u2019ve done at least 20 of these L87s, and a handful of LT1/LT4s for this failure. I\u2019ve had a few L82/L84 with rod issues and ringland issues with &lt;20k too. Quality left out of seemingly nowhere."
