It will give you about 2 more inches for deficit movement, without having to strain your neck back . Also reduces the strain on your wrists since they are at a more severe angle than normal. With the foam yoga blocks, you won&#39;t hurt your knuckles. 2) If you do this at home, do it in front of the stairs. You can adjust the angle by changing which stair tread you use. 3) Use a weight vest for overloading. Once you do this for a while, you&#39;ll start blowing out the # of reps and will need to increase the load to keep seeing growth. You can use the vest for overloading a lot of other body weight exercises too, like squats.",

            "Interesting, but what is the point. Even if we discover a planet with life on it what do we do with this information? It will likely be many hundreds or thousands of light years away, so we can only attempt to send a message to them which will take hundreds, or thousands of years to get a reply. The truth is we probably aren&#39;t alone, but the vastness of space and current technology means that we essentially are."

The only difference comes when measuring by volume (like teaspoons) because kosher salt&#39;s larger flakes take up more space. 1 tsp of fine salt holds more crystals than 1 tsp of kosher salt, so you&#39;d get more sodium that way. But if you&#39;re weighing your salt (which is more accurate for baking!), 100g of either salt will give you the same sodium content. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPUux4h4Mf8&amp;t=304\">5:04</a>"

            "Bro, go to settings and click on initial tune parameters enter prop size and battery type, if you are using mission planner. I recommend mission planner. Reduce p , I , d (keep p and i equal)  of both roll and pitch till you get a stable hover in stabilize flight mode. Better use a telemetry radio instead of connecting a laptop to it every time. Reduce p and I in larger steps than D. All these value can be found in extended tuning tab of mission planner. Now once you get a stable hover , switch to althold with mot_thst_hover param set to 2. Disable it after a 30 second flight by changing the parameter to 0. Plug in the hover learn value into throttle to accel gains p= hover learn, I = 2*hover learn, then takeoff in althold and switch to loiter. If everything is fine, you can proceed with autotune. Don&#39;t use dampers for autopilot, it already has two IMUs damped internally. Square tubes (motor arms) can cause vibration because of pulse from the propeller,  passing over it , better use a round pipe or try notch filtering. Probably, you can&#39;t autotune it if the flight time is very less.",

I would like to encourage you to buy any property adjacent to yours if you can afford it. Encroachment is a real problem in many places and the only way to avoid it is to buy the property as it becomes available. If you don&#39;t then the people that get it might start complaining about you.  Too much noise, too much dust, too much smoke, too many trucks,  etc. And if you decide to get livestock then there is the smell. The only way to protect yourself is to separate yourself from the complaining.  You&#39;ve got a good thing going going and I and many others enjoy watching. Hang in there.",

            "TIP:   When &quot;trimming&quot; the edge guide of a new saw (or replacement), do not put it OVER the edge of the wood.  Instead, find a scrap piece, and make an actual cut... trimming the edge guide in the process.  This gives you a much cleaner and more accurate edge.<br><br>Or, maybe that&#39;s just with the cheaper track saws... haven&#39;t been able to afford an expensive one LOL",
            "The reason that Makita doesn&#39;t seem as exciting as other tool brands comes down to their core culture as a high quality Japanese tool company.  They don&#39;t rush into anything, they don&#39;t jump on bandwagons, and they don&#39;t release anything until they think it is ready.  This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t make mistakes, or that they don&#39;t occasionally miss the mark; but it does mean that their build quality is top notch and when they do release a new tool, it is often a game changer in that tool class.  The flip side is that they release a new model every 7-10 years instead of every 2 years.  They take that time to study how the tool is used and how it breaks so that the next one is better.  I appreciate that they don&#39;t try to make the most powerful tool, they try to make the best tool for the job and job rating.  Sure, you can take a Milwaukee and push it till it screams and it will most often the most powerful version of that tool, but it will tear itself apart while doing that. A Makita will just shut off if you start asking it to do something it isn&#39;t intended to do.  On their impact wrenches people often complain that you can&#39;t slap a too big socket on it and blow it to bits, but the makita will just shut down and tell you &quot;go get a bigger wrench that is meant for this bulldozer, I&#39;m designed for a civic&quot;."

When you get home you feel like you rode a hard tail sportster down a pothole pocked dirt mountain road!! Plus the silica dust is a keillor!! Definitely no fun over 40!! Those guys are beasties pounding those chipping hammers all day. Can&#39;t get those muscles at a gym, never felt a grip like a Mason, thin wiry Iron Muscle, crush your hand like a daisy, hands are hard like dried leather. Much respect and admiration to all working on this one, I will admit I&#39;m just a little jealous, this is a beautiful example of how to do it right, even if it costs you a bit of time. In the end the timeless structure will last long after we are all gone.  That is what I love most about restoration, bringing it back from the brink and making it shine once again for future generations to enjoy.",

            "I worked as a CNA for a while, and me and one of my patients decided to play a prank on the dour old nurse on duty. The patient had a catheter, so I hid the bag on the back of the chair. I got a new catheter bag and filled it up with white grape juice, then strapped it to her leg (she was in on it, and wanted to do it) just like a normal catheter. When the nurse came in to assess her for the am meds, I pretended like I was emptying the catheter into a brand new measuring cylinder. After draining the very uriney-looking juice into the container, I stood there chatting up the nurse, and then casually just started taking sips... <br><br>She didn&#39;t notice the first one, but the second time her eyes went wide and she shrieked &quot;what the hell are you doing?!!&quot; By then, the patient was convulsing with silent  laughter. <br><br>We also had a young guy who was paralyzed, but alert and responsive. I asked him if he wanted to play a prank on the oncoming night shift girl, and he nodded yes, and grinned. He was pretty big, so I usually had him in bed and squared away before she came on. That night, I pushed his chair into the bathroom like usual, but left him in it and threw a sheet over him, tucked just to the side so he was hidden, but could still see what was happening. I then went and laid down in his bed and covered myself with the sheet, and put my limbs in the position he was usually stuck in. <br><br>When she came in to check on him, she pulled the sheet back and I jumped out. She screamed so loud half of the administration came running down from the nurse&#39;s station to see what was wrong. The guy was in the corner laughing his head off and grinning from ear to ear.

            "As a risk of rain 2 (and other rougelikes) fan I have to say I REALLY dislike the fact that majority of the artifacts have huge downsides, risk of rain has it where all of the regular items give you flat buffs and only special items (Lunars) give you both a positive and negative, however, the positive and negative combine to completely alter the gameplay: for example stone flux pauldron doubles your health but halves your movement speed. The way the downsides cripple OTHER towers seems so backwards to me, I understand how it\u2019s trying to get you to only use that tower or similar towers but I feel like it should where it strengthens a tower in one way but nerfs that same tower in a different way to change how you use that single tower building more opportunities for synergies between towers with new and cool ways to use each of them (also making an opening for more artifact diversity)",

When I tell you we service cars like this all the time I am not exaggerating. Pretty much every 5 cars is similar to this or other very dirty ones you&#39;ve covered. It has been helpful to see your work and inspirational to me. I have started to lose the happiness for my job that I first had because of the specific nature of everything going on in the work place that out of professionality I will refrain from discussing.
